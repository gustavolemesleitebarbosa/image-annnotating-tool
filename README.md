   - Clone the [Repo](https://github.com/gustavolemesleitebarbosa/overview-ai-challenge) into your local machine
   - Make sure to be using a supported node version on your terminal
   - Run `pnpm install` (or yarn/npm equivalent) to install deps locally
   - run `pnpm dev`
   - Go to to your browser, the app should be accessible on http://localhost:3000

## Features Guide

### 1. Class Management

Classes represent different annotation categories. Each class has:

- Unique name
- Distinctive color
- Generated ID

Default classes include common objects like "Car", "Tree", "Road", etc. New classes can be added through the UI.

### 2. Annotation Tools

#### Brush Tool

- Freeform drawing
- Adjustable brush size
- Semi-transparent fill
- Collision detection

#### Polygon Tool

- Click to place points
- Auto-closes when near starting point
- Collision detection
- Clear visual feedback

### 3. COCO Export

Exports annotations in COCO format with:

- Image information
- Category definitions
- Segmentation data
- Bounding boxes
- Area calculations

### 4. Basic Usage and Tools

# Annotation Tool Documentation

## Getting Started

To begin using the annotation tool:

- Click the **Upload Image** button in the sidebar to add a new image.
- Once uploaded, you can start adding annotations.

## Class Management

  - To annotate with specific classes, choose a predefined class from the **Select a Class** drop-down menu.
  - Alternatively, create a custom class by clicking the **Add Class** button.
  - Custom classes are stored in your browser's local storage, so they persist across sessions.
  - When creating a new class, ensure that the name and color are unique.

## Annotation Tools 

  - Select either the **Brush** or **Polygon** tool from the sidebar to start annotating.
  - Once selected, you can begin adding annotations to the canvas.

### Undo Feature

  - The **Undo** button allows you to revert the last annotation action:
  - For polygons, it can undo the last added point or remove the entire shape.
  - For the brush tool, it removes the last drawn stroke.
  - Multiple undo actions can be performed sequentially.

## Annotation Control & COCO Export

  - Click the **Toggle Annotations** button to display the list of annotations.
  - The annotation list can be positioned at the **top** or **bottom** of the window for better accessibility.
  - Clicking an annotation in the list removes it from the canvas.
  - To export annotations in **COCO format**, click the **Export COCO** button. This generates a JSON file containing the annotations.

## Collision Detection

  - The app includes a collision detection system to prevent overlapping annotations.
  - Collision detection is based on **bounding boxes**, meaning that even if two annotations do not actually intersect, they may still be flagged as a collision.
  - This limitation is due to Fabric.js not offering a straightforward way to detect precise intersection beyond bounding box checks.
  - For more information on this limitation, see this [Stack Overflow thread](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23258284/collision-detection-fabrics-js).
  - If the current collision detection implementation does not meet your expectations, you can switch to a branch of this project that does not include collision testing. However, please note that in this version, annotations can overlap freely. It is entirely the user's responsibility to manage and avoid annotation overlaps. To access it, just run on terminal:``` git checkout branch-collision-free  ```, there is a separate demo video for this version: [Demo Video, non collision mode](https://youtu.be/hc6wzxYo5DQ)



## Best Practices

1. **Performance**

   - Limit canvas size to viewport dimensions
   - Use appropriate brush sizes
   - Manage state updates efficiently

2. **Annotation Guidelines**

   - Avoid overlapping annotations
   - Complete polygons before switching tools
   - Use appropriate tool for the task

3. **Data Management**
   - Regular exports
   - Validate COCO format before saving
   - Monitor annotation count

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

1. **Collision Detection**

   - Red highlight indicates overlap
   - Annotation is automatically removed
   - Try repositioning or using smaller brush size

2. **Polygon Tool**

   - Ensure points are placed accurately
   - Click near starting point to close
   - Use undo for mistakes

3. **Export Issues**
   - Verify all annotations are complete
   - Check class assignments
   - Ensure image is loaded properly

## Technical Details

### State Management

- Uses React's useState for UI state
- Fabric.js canvas state management
- History tracking for undo functionality

### Event Handling

- Mouse events for polygon creation
- Path creation events for brush tool
- Canvas rendering events

### Data Structure

```typescript
type Annotation = {
  type: "path" | "polygon";
  class: Class;
  object: FabricObject;
};
```

### COCO Format Structure

```typescript
interface COCOData {
  images: Array<{
    id: number;
    width: number;
    height: number;
  }>;
  annotations: Array<{
    id: number;
    image_id: number;
    category_id: number;
    segmentation: number[][];
    area: number;
    bbox: number[];
  }>;
  categories: Array<{
    id: number;
    name: string;
    supercategory: string;
  }>;
}
```

### Basic Implementation

```tsx
import Canvas from "~/components/Canvas/Canvas";

function AnnotationApp() {
  return (
    <Canvas
      tool={selectedTool}
      brushSize={10}
      imageUrl={imageUrl}
      selectedClass={selectedClass}
      classes={classes}
    />
  );
}
```

### Props Interface

```typescript
interface CanvasProps {
  tool: "brush" | "polygon" | null;
  brushSize: number;
  imageUrl: string | null;
  selectedClass: Class | null;
  classes: Class[];
}

interface Class {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  color: string;
}
```

## Notes

- The annotation tool is designed to enhance efficiency while ensuring accurate annotations.
- Future improvements may refine collision detection and introduce additional functionalities based on user feedback.
